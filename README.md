# Octahedron
Octahedron is a rewrite of the [Tesseract game engine](http://tesseract.gg/), itself built upon the [Cube 2 engine](http://sauerbraten.org/) engine.
It aims to make extensive use of modern C++20 features and design practices, to capture the customizability and overall feeling of the engine, while improving modulability and maintainability.
While its predecessors Tesseract and Cube2/Sauerbraten are both simultanouesly a game and an engine, Octahedron aims to purely be a game engine.

While not guaranteed to work out this way in the end, my goal is for the currently in-development game Valiance to make use of Octahedron.

Feel free to pull the code, build it, run it, contribute via pull requests, however you may not distribute your modifications to the engine in any other way.
My goal is to eventually change the license to another much more permissive, such as LGPL or ZLIB, when I judge the engine is complete enough to stand on its own.
